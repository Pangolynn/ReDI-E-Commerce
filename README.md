# ReDI E-Commerce Project Description

This application is a presentation of the skills learned at ReDI School of Digital
Integration, and used as my final project for the 'Web Dev Advanced' course. 
It is a mock e-commerce website built with React + Vite, where it fetches
mock products from an API (https://dummyjson.com/products) and displays a list
of these products to the user. You can then view each product individually,
filter the products, add them to a shopping cart, and (mock) checkout.
